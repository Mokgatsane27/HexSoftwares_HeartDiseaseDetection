# HexSoftwares_HeartDiseaseDetection# HexSoftwares - Heart Disease Detection (Project 2)

This project is part of my HEX SOFTWARES internship. The goal is to build a machine learning model that detects the risk of heart disease based on patient data.

## Objective

To predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

## Dataset

We are using a simulated version of the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**, which contains information about patients such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Max Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- And more...

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Model

We trained a classification model using **Logistic Regression** to detect heart disease. Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script:  
   `python src/heart_disease_detection.py`
